This is a little script for the ESP32 written in Arduino. This will transform your ESP32 into a bluetooth keyboard. It allows for 4 buttons that send out the letters `h`, `j`, `k` and `l` when pressed. One more pin is reserved for a led to be able to provide the user some feedback when a button press was received properly or when a connection still needs to be set up.
